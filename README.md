# Cancer Transcriptome ML

Implementation of supervised machine learning models applied to cancer transcriptomic data.

This project explores classification strategies inspired by the study:

"A machine learning classifier trained on cancer transcriptomes detects NF1 inactivation signal in glioblastoma"

The goal was to reproduce and evaluate machine learning approaches for detecting molecular signatures in high-dimensional gene expression datasets.
